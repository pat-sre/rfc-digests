# rfc-digests

A curated collection of high-signal, human-readable digests of foundational RFCs — one document at a time.

This project aims to distill dense networking specifications into practical, precise summaries. 
Each digest highlights core ideas, protocol mechanics, and mental models to internalize the RFC without compromising technical fidelity.

## 🔍 Purpose

RFCs are the DNA of the internet. But they’re also verbose, archaic, and hard to absorb. This repo translates key RFCs into:

- ✅ Clean summaries
- ✅ Visual explanations (where relevant)
- ✅ Protocol workflows and message flows
- ✅ Historical and practical context
- ✅ Why-it-matters insights

No copy-paste. No over-simplification. Just clarity.

## 📘 Current Digests

| RFC | Title                                 | Status     |
|-----|---------------------------------------|------------|
| 793 | Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)   | 🚧 WIP      |
| ... | ...                                   | 🚧 WIP      |

Digests are in `/digests/RFC####.md`.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Because studying RFCs shouldn’t feel like deciphering ancient scrolls.  
Because understanding protocols like TCP, IP, DNS, and HTTP at the spec level is a superpower.
